  ## Description 
  This project will speed up development by reducing the time it takes to create a well laid out README for a developer's project. Running this application using Node.js will generate a README for the user to use in their repository. This README for example, was created via this application.

  ## Installation
  Clone this repo to your local PC. You will then be able to use it.

  ## Usage
  This will decrease development time by allowing a user to generate a README much quicker than the traditional method of typing each heading out and organizing everything.
